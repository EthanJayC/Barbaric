# BARBARIC
Unity game project for Uni, my first one!

In its current form, it's a physics based, horde-style hack & slash.
Survive the onslaught for 5 minutes, be quick to cull the horde; for they're dangerous in large numbers!

Especially watch out for the red Gors, they may die as easily as the Goblins, but they pack a punch!

A quick tutorial:
- WSAD keys - Move
- Spacebar - Dash
- Left mouse button - Attack
- Tab - Brings up in-game shop to spend skulls on some cool abilities (WIP)
- Esc - Pause menu with music slider and quit

In-game shop currently has keybindings due to the button functions not currently working
- 1: buy helf
- 2: buy attack buff (only purchasable once atm, although plan to scale it in future) 
- - NOTE: The attack upgrade costs only 5 skulls so you can test it out, after that you'll rack up the skulls quick
- 3: buy dash cooldown, although once you upgrade several times you'll get UNLIMITED DASH! unintended consequence of not clamping the cooldown reset value lol

Enjoy!
