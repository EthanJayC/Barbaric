# BARBARIC
Unity game project for Uni, my first one!

In its current form, it's a physics based, horde-style hack & slash.

A quick tutorial:
WSAD keys - move character
Spacebar - Dash
Left mousebutton - Spam to kill
Tab - Brings up in-game shop to spend skulls on some cool abilities (WIP)
Esc - Pause menu with music slider and quit

In-game shop currently has keybindings due to the button functions not currently working
1 - buy helf
2 - buy attack buff (only purchasable once atm, although plan to scale it in future)
3 - buy dash cooldown
