# BARBARIC
Unity game project for Uni, my first one!

In its current form, it's a physics based, horde-style hack & slash.

A quick tutorial:
- WSAD keys - move character
- Spacebar - Dash
- Left mousebutton - Spam to kill
- Tab - Brings up in-game shop to spend skulls on some cool abilities (WIP)
- Esc - Pause menu with music slider and quit

In-game shop currently has keybindings due to the button functions not currently working
- 1: buy helf
- 2: buy attack buff (only purchasable once atm, although plan to scale it in future) 
- - NOTE: The attack upgrade costs only 5 skulls so you can test it out, after that you'll rack up the skulls quick
- 3: buy dash cooldown, although once you upgrade several times you'll get UNLIMITED DASH! unintended consequence of not clamping the cooldown reset value lol

that's all, have fun, it's a little janky atm though!
